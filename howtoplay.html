<p style="font-size:18px;">
This new Flashpoint: South China Sea module was created by <b>Brian 
Reynolds</b>. 
    
<br> <br> Special thanks to <b>Game Designer Harold Buchanan</b> who
answered numerous esoteric questions during development; <b>Stephen Stone</b> who 
created the beautiful "wooden pieces" and drop shadows; and <b>Terry Leeds</b> who helped with locating all of the art.

<br> <br>The module is presently maintained by <b>Brian 
Reynolds</b> - please report any problems to 
<b>brian@brianreynolds.net</b>.

    <h2 style="font-size:26px">First Things First</h2><p style="font-size:18px;">
Under the "Help" menu you will find a link to the latest version of the Flashpoint: South China Sea rulebook, in case you are 
still learning how to play the game itself, or just need to "look up a rule".

<h3 style="font-size:22px">Using This Module</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">
          The module is designed to work intuitively by dragging and dropping pieces from one spot to another,
          and by right+clicking on objects (particularly cards) to bring up menus of possible interactions (e.g.
          "Play for Event" vs. "Play for Ops", etc). 
          <br><br>
          <h3 style="font-size:22px">Scoring</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">
          Scoring calculations are automated if you right+click a scoring card and select "Score this Card" (you may
          also simply perform the calculations manually and then "flip" the card face down yourself). 
          <br><br>
          <h3 style="font-size:22px">Active Card</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">
          The most recent card played is shown in the "Active Card" box - this is useful particularly when playing
          a card for Mode so that the most recently discarded card can also be readily viewed. Whenever a new card
          is played the previous one is automatically placed in the discard pile.
          <br><br>
          <h3 style="font-size:22px">Political Warfare</h3>
          <p style="font-size:18px;">
          When resolving Political Warfare, you can either right+click the event deck and select "Reveal Political 
          Warfare Card", or simply drag the top card to the "Resolve Political Warfare" box. After resolving the
          effects, right clicking the card in that box will allow you the option to move the card to the bottom of
          the Event deck.
